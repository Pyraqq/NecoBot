# Neco-Bot
---
The almighty Neco-Arc from the hit game Melty Blood now comes in modern, never before seen, DISCORD BOT FORMAT. It can talk, and do someo ther stuff, its hilarious! Really funny! Make it look for cool images! Or make it ***KILL*** your enemies! (Due to the government I must say that this is actually ***not*** a function).

Neco-Bot is made with Discord.js / Node.js, to run the code natively, you must first create a bot in the Discord Developer Portal, for more info click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItWqxsddU5s).

Afterwards get Node.js by downloading it form [here](https://nodejs.org/en/), afterwards initialise a folder for your bot, do so by typing either `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm init` (depending on which you use) into the console, make sure you are in the directory you want to set up your bot in before doing this! Once youre done with that proceed with

```
npm install discord.js
```
After that you'll need to configure all the enviroment variables used in the code so that it matches yours.

Burunyu.
